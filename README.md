Online Store
  This is the first 3 pages of my online store that I will create for the Final Project. It contains the Homepage, Login Page, Products Page, andan email subscription form.
  
  These 3 web pages provide the main structure for my online store. Through these pages, the user can view the sites Homepage, create an account with the store, and sign up for email notifications to receive 10% off their first order. 
  
  Homepage:
  * There is a navigation bar at the top of the Homepage where the user can find:
      * A dropdown "Menu" that leads the user to the "Products page" or what will eventually be the search page. 
      * A "Login" button that sends the user to the "Login page" form. 
      * A "Cart" button that will soon take the user to their shopping cart. 
  * On the left side, it shows the email subscription/discount message with a link to a form for the user to fill out their information. It also shows some product categories that will soon be available.
  * Finally, on the right side, and majority of the screen, the user can see various aesthetic pictures until the site releases products.
  * External CSS: "homepage.css"
  * Inline CSS
  * Internal CSS
      
  Login Page:
  * This page allows the user to insert their information needed to create a user account. If the fields are left blank, the user will get an error and will be asked to input information. It also uses regex validation to validation the phone number.
  * External javascript: "login.js" file
  * External CSS: "login.css
  * Inline CSS
  
  Products Page:
  * This page will show all the products being sold. It will present an image of the product, product name, description, and price. Since it currently has no products, it contains more aesthetic images, a funny video, a GIF, and random text. 
  * This page also has a navigation bar at the top that can take the user back to the Homepage.
  * Internal Javascript
  * External CSS: "products.css"
